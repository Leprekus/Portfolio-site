# Portfolio-site

My first Portfolio. I plan to gradually update My website as I complete projects in my front-end course to upload here. 
This is a place where all of my experience is gathered. On the blogs section I will add things that I have found 
difficult throughout my journey and how I've overcome them. I also want to include techniques that I like, that
have caught my attention, or that I have found through experimentation.
